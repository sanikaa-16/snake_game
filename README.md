Snake Game üêç

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The player controls a snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Features

Simple and fun gameplay - Control the snake using the arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
Scoring system - Keep track of the score with a scoreboard that updates in real time.
Game Over Detection - The game ends when the snake hits a wall or collides with itself.
